popover
=======

popover.js is a JavaScript popup/lightbox utility that allows loading any content into an un-styled popup window.

popover.js provides the basic styles to position the popup and display a dark transparent overlay to draw focus away 
from the page beneath.  Any other styles are left to you.

Content can be loaded with AJAX, plain text/html strings, or using existing DOM nodes.
